install from toolsheds:			In:		Under:
	- BWA 						test	NGS: Mapping
	- Fastq Groomer				main	NGS: QC and manipulation
	- sam_to_bam				main	Convert formats
	- realigner_target_creator	test	NGS: GATK (beta)

	- pileup_parser				main	NGS: Samtools


Map individual NA06984 with BWA:
	- Upload reference genome "human_17_v37.fasta" with tool "Get data". The files you is located in <FILEPATH>
	- Upload files "NA06984.ILLUMINA.low_coverage.17q_1.fq" and "NA06984.ILLUMINA.low_coverage.17q_2.fq" using the same tool.
		- Both are in ILLUMINA 1.8+ format, and will need to be converted to Sanger format.
			- Use "Fastq Groomer" (install from main Galaxy toolshed) to convert. Located under Galaxy tool category "NGS: QC and manipulation"
		
Merge alignments with BWA:
	- Use tool "Map with BWA for Illumina".
	- Specify read groups in "BWA settings to use; Full parameter list". After specifying read groups, you will need to enter some required fields:
		Read group identiÔ¨Åer (ID)								e.g. "sample_1"
		Library name (LB)										e.g. "smp_1_lib"
		Platform/technology used to produce the reads (PL)		"ILLUMINA"
		Sample (SM).											e.g. "NA06984"
	- BWA produces binary .sai files that are processed and merged into .sam
	- .sam uncompressed human-readable, so we need to covert into binary .bam files using "sam_to_bam" install from main toolshed into category "Convert formats". Sam-to-bam sorts and indexes the file automatically.

Realign around indel sites:
	- Use tool "Realigner Target Creator" to create location data for the next step.
	- Use tool "Indel Realigner" to realign reads around probable indel sites.

Call variants:
	- GATK (more and more accepted as better than samtools, which we will now use) not fully integrated into Galaxy just yet. 
	- Samtools' Generate pileup (sam_pileup) from main toolshed.
		- Make sure pileup output is considered "pileup" data rather than "tabular". Edit the output in your history, and under the "datatypes" tab, set new type to "pileup".
	- Filter pileup using Samtools' pileup_parser from main toolshed.

Display filtered pileup data using e.g. IGV or UCSC Genome Browser
